## Files tab
* **AIO Multiplier 2077 (main  file):** Main file of the mod, the maximum value of each multiplier is **100**. You just need it for everything to go smoothly (along with the requirements, obviously).
* **High Multipliers Menu (optional file):** For those who, for some reason, don't think the maximum of 100 for the multipliers is enough, this file increases the maximum value of the ModSettings multiplier options to **500**. Install the main file first and then this one.
* **Low Multipliers Menu (optional file):** And for those who think 100 is too high, this file lowers the maximum value of each multiplier to **50**. Install the main file first and then this one.
