## Files tab
* **AIO Multiplier 2077 (main  file):** Main file of the mod, the maximum value of each multiplier is **100**. You just need it for everything to go smoothly (along with the requirements, obviously).
* **High Multipliers Menu (optional file):** For those who, for some reason, don't think the maximum of 100 for the multipliers is enough, this file increases the maximum value of the ModSettings multiplier options to **500**. Install the main file first and then this one.
* **Low Multipliers Menu (optional file):** And for those who think 100 is too high, this file lowers the maximum value of each multiplier to **50**. Install the main file first and then this one.

## Installation
* **__Main File:__** Just extract the main file to the Cyberpunk 2077 root folder, or use [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files) (Recommended) for an automatic installation.
* **__Optional Files:__** Just extract the main file to the Cyberpunk 2077 root folder and replace the previously installed main file, or use [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files) (Recommended) for an automatic installation and, when informed about the conflict between files in Vortex, just select the optional file as **`After`**. Install only ONE OF THE OPTIONAL FILES.
